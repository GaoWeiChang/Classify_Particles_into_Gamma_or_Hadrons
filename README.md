# Classify Particles into Gamma or Hadrons

## Goal
This project make us understand how to apply PCA for building the classification model and compare the performance of the model with PCA features and  the model with original features.

## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I will classify particles into gamma(signal) or hadrons(background). Given that the features are correlated, I will perform PCA to get a new set of features, and select the features that contain the most information.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).
