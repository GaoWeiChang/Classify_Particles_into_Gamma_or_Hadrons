# Classify Particles into Gamma or Hadrons

## Goal
To understand how to apply PCA for building the classification model and compare the performance of the model with PCA features and  the model with original features.

## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I will classify particles into gamma(signal) or hadrons(background). Given that the features are correlated, I will perform PCA to get a new set of features, and select the features that contain the most information.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).
